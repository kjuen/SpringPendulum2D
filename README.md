SpringPendulum2D
================

This application provides a 2D visualiztion of a mass attached to a
spring (pt2 system) together with some of the  plots typically used in
control design.

The running application can be seen at
<http://kjuen.github.io/SpringPendulum2D/>.

To run the application locally, just clone the repository and open
`SpringPendulum.html`. It should run out of the box since all libraries
are included.

The spring is considered as a second order system the equations of
which are listed in the documents in the theory directory.

The parameters of the spring can be changed only when the simulation
is stopped using the `Stop` button.
